# Zeals Frontend Test

## Instructions

Given the mock data from `mockdata.ts`, create a UI that displays each chatbot as a card component in a grid.

Normally, you would work from a design file, but use this opportunity to express your creativity and UI sense.

- Clicking a card component should `console.log` the bot's ID.

- Feel free to use any CSS tool you like.

- Display all the data from the mock data, and show your knowledge of HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React!
