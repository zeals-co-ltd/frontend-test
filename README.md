# Zeals Frontend Test

## Setup
- Fork the repo to your personal Github account
- Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run dev`

## Instructions

Given the mock data from `mockdata.ts`, create a UI that displays each chatbot as a card component in a grid.

Use the wireframe below to give you a rough idea of what the page should look like.

- Clicking a card component should `console.log` the bot's ID.

- Feel free to use any CSS tool you like.

- Display all the data from the mock data, and show your knowledge of HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React!
